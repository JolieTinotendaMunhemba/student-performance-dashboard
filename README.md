# Student Performance Dashboard
This Student Performance Dashboard is a Flask-based web application that empowers students to analyse their academic performance and study habits. This project combines Python, machine learning, and data visualisation to provide insights into how study hours impact grades. 
# Features
Data Input Form: Submit student names, grades, and study hours for tracking.
Predictive Analytics: A linear regression model predicts grades based on study hours.
Visualisation: Interactive graph showcasing the relationship between study hours and grades.
Dashboard: View all submitted student data in a clean, tubular format. 
# Technologies Used
Backend: Python (Flask framework)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression Model)
Database: SQLite for capturing and storing student data
Visualisation: Matplotlib for generating graphs
Frontend: HTML, CSS
# How The App Works
1. Users submit their name, grades, and study hours via a form.
2. Data is securely stored in an SQLite database.
3. The dashboard displays all entered data in an organised table.
4. The app predicts grades based on entered study hours using a machine learning model.
5. The graph feature visualises the correlation between study hours and grade.
# Project Highlights
This project demonstrates a practical use of machine learning and web development to create tools for personal growth and education. it is ideal for showcasing skills in backend development, database integration, and data analysis.
